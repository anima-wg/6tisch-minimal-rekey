  description
   "This module defines an interface to set and interrogate
    the short (16-bit) layer-2 address used in 802.15.4
    TSCH mode networks.  The short addresses are used
    in L2 frames to save space.  A lifetime is included
    in terms of TSCH Absolute Slot Number, which acts
    as a monotonically increasing clock.  ";
